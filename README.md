# Hello World

## Introduction
This project was created to test out some of the JavaScript techniques we learned in the KU Coding Bootcamp.  It incorporates the location.assign() and fetch(url) methods to cycle between a series of pages displaying text in various languages, and fetching information from the WikiPedia API about some of the countries that use each language.  It's not perfect, but it's been a fun time-suck.
